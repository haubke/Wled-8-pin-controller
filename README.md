I Will put design files in this repository. 
I Will not be held responsible for any damage this device May cause!.
Use at your own risk!. I am not an Electronic expert.

This devices uses open source software from a third party called WLED.
I build the firmware from source. 

Pcb's where ordered at jlcpcb. Components sourced  from aliexpress.
Total build Cost 200â‚¬ for 20 pcs. 

I tested it with both 2400 leds. And 1200leds. More is possible. Fps Will drop.
I Use maximum of 150 leds per port. And only with moving  images. 
The device is designed as a christmas light show controller. Not as a static display.
Power draw Will be to high. Pcb is designed for about 30Amps. Probably less.
